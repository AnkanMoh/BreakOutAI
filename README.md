AI Agent Information Retrieval Project
üöÄ Overview
This project is an AI-powered information retrieval system that takes in a dataset (CSV or Google Sheets) and performs web searches to extract specified information for each entity. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to process search results, offering structured outputs for end-users through a simple, intuitive dashboard.

üåü Features
File Upload & Google Sheets Integration: Supports uploading CSV files or connecting to Google Sheets.
Dynamic Query Builder: Allows users to customize search queries with placeholders for specific entities.
Automated Web Search: Uses APIs to perform searches for each entity and retrieves relevant results.
LLM-Based Information Extraction: Extracts specific information from search results based on user-defined prompts.
Downloadable Results: Users can download extracted data in CSV format.
üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
